BAGEL is a model-agnostic, modular, fully customizable Python framework for programmable protein design.

The package formalizes the protein design task as an optimization (sampling) over an energy landscape.

The BAGEL package is made up of several components that need to be specified to form a protein engineering task:

| **Component**      | **Description**                                                                                      | **Examples**                                         |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `EnergyTerms`      | Define specific design constraints as terms in the energy function.                                  | `TemplateMatchEnergy`, `PLDDTEnergy`, `HydrophobicEnergy` |
| `Oracles`          | Provide information (often via ML models) to compute optimization/sampling metrics.<br>Oracles are typically wrappers around models from [boileroom](https://github.com/softnanolab/boileroom). | `ESMFold`, `ESM-2`                                   |
| `Minimizers`       | Algorithms that sample or optimize sequences to find optima or diverse variants.                     | Monte Carlo, `SimulatedTempering`, `SimulatedAnnealing` |
| `MutationProtocols`| Methods for perturbing sequences to generate new candidates.                                         | `Canonical`, `GrandCanonical`                            |

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

The easiest way to install BAGEL is through PyPI:

```bash
pip install biobagel
```

**Optional Extras:**

- For local protein model execution (requires GPU):
```bash
pip install biobagel[local]
```

- For development (testing, linting, documentation):
```bash
pip install biobagel[dev]
```

### From Source

If you want to install from source or contribute to development:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/softnanolab/bagel
```

2. Install `uv` (if not already installed):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

3. Navigate to the repository:

```bash
cd bagel
```

4. Install the environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

**Optional Extras:**

- For local protein model execution (requires GPU):
```bash
uv sync --extra local
```

- For development (testing, linting, documentation):
```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

- For all extras:
```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```


## Usage

### With PyPI Installation

```bash
python scripts/script.py
```

### With Source Installation

```bash
uv run python scripts/script.py
```

To execute templates reproducibly from the [technical report manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.05.663138v1) (within statistical noise due to the nature of Monte Carlo sampling), follow release v0.1.0, also stored on Zenodo [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/968747892.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15812348). Otherwise, use the most recent `biobagel` distribution.

## Oracles
One can either run Oracles locally, or remotely.

- `use_modal=True`: Run Oracles on [Modal](www.modal.com). Using the [boileroom](https://pypi.org/project/boileroom) package, running remotely is made seamless and does not require installing any dependencies. However, you need to have credits to use Modal.
- `use_modal=False`: Run Oracles locally through [boileroom](https://pypi.org/project/boileroom). You need a GPU with suitable memory requirements.

To use Modal, one needs to create an account and authenticate through:

        modal token new

You also need to set `HF_MODEL_DIR` to an accessible folder, where HuggingFace models will be stored.

### Google Colab
A prototyping, but unscalable alterantive is to run BAGEL in Google Colab, having an access to a T4 processing unit for free. See this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dtX8j6t5VhSed4iiqSrjM35DyPSFE1yF?usp=sharing), which includes the installation, and the template script for [simple binder](scripts/binders/simple_binder.py).

### Examples
[Templates](scripts/) and [example applications from the manuscript](scripts/technical-report/) are included as ready-to-run Python scripts.
